# Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis:

Is the average number of blue cars taken during the weekend for area 75001 equal to that of area code 93260 at 0.05 significance level?

H0: µ1 = µ2 at α = 0.05

Alternate Hypothesis:

Is the average number of blue cars taken during the weekend for area 75001 not equal to that of area code 93260 at 0.05 significance level?

Ha: µ1 ≠ µ2 at α = 0.05
